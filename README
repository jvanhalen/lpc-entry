  Name       Z-index    Desc
  -----------------------------
  Ground     0          Used for bottom layer in tile maps.
  Overlay    1          Used for additional overlay in tile maps
  Behind     2          For some special graphics behind game object (quiver, mostly)
  Body       3          Basic body animation (human + skeleton)
  Equipment  4          Additional armor or wear over the body layer.
  Weapon     5          All weapons stored with this
  Collision  6          Not rendered, shall contain only transparent tiles that help in tile
                        mouse selection.
  Mouse      7          For transparent collision layer over all other sprites in game object.

  Front      8          Used for front layer elements in tile maps (appears over game objects)



KNOWN ISSUES:

    If Crafty is initialized and some component is hidden after that from page,
    Crafty's mouse related coordinates get busted unless you do window resize.
    I believe that this is browser-related and _needs_ to be taken into account
    when designing a page.

    Crafty entities must have .collision(polygon) defined for all entities that wish to use
    SAT collision algorithm. Otherwise sprite MBR is used for _both_.
