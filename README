** GAS fantasy edition **

SERVER:
 - clients should connect to the demo server running at gassrv.dyndns.org:8282
 - maple.js
 - couchDB
 - communicates synchronously with clients (JSON data format)

CLIENT:

- Game object must contain
       Body entity (ie. background animation)
       Head equipment entity (optional)
       Torso entity (optional)
       Belt entity (optional)
       Hands entity (optional)
       Legs entity (optional)
       Feet entity (toes) 
       Weapon entity (optional)

- Graphics layers (z-indices)

  Name       Z-index    Desc
  -----------------------------
  Ground     0          Used for bottom layer in tile maps. 
  Overlay    1          Used for additional overlay in tile maps
  Behind     2          For some special graphics behind game object (quiver, mostly)
  Body       3          Basic body animation (human + skeleton)
  Equipment  4          Additional armor or wear over the body layer.
  Weapon     5          All weapons stored with this
  Mouse      6          For transparent collision layer over all other sprites in game object.

  Front      7          Used for front layer elements in tile maps (appears over game objects)

  Collision  -          Not rendered, shall contain only tiles that are inaccessible 
                        in the tile map.  (Mouse      6+        pathfinding layer = collision)

KNOWN ISSUES:

    If Crafty is initialized and some component is hidden after that from page,
    Crafty's mouse related coordinates get busted unless you do window resize. 
    I believe that this is browser-related and _needs_ to be taken into account 
    when designing a page.
    
    Crafty entities must have .collision(polygon) defined for all entities that wish to use 
    SAT collision algorithm. Otherwise sprite MBR is used for _both_.
